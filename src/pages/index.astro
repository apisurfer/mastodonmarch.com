				If you've used Mastodon a couple of times but always felt like
				something is missing, that something might as well be people like you and me!
				For a bit longer than a day or two :)
			</p>

			<p>
				With the rest of the social networks focused on making profit and establishing market dominance
				Mastodon feels like a natural alternative and hedge for the future. Its decentralized model seems to be a
				closer representation of real-life independent and small communities grown around a specific
				topic or theme where content and substance beat money and power.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'll commit to a full month of Mastodon usage in March of 2023. and would love to be accompanied
				by other people joining the initiative. If nothing else you can consider it as a detox month from
				what the rest of the social networks have become.
			</p>

			<p class="my-10 text-center font-light text-2xl cursive max-w-sm m-auto leading-9">
				See you on Mastodon during the month of March and onwards!
